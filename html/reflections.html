<h2> How about this class?</h2>
<img id="question" src="../images/questionmark.png" alt="Question mark">
<p>This quarter definitely has been an interesting one. I wasn’t overly stressed, as I was already familiar with the subject, but I knew it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park either.</p>
<p>It has been fascinating to see how much everything has stayed pretty much the same over the 10 year gap in my technical education, but at the same time, it’s gotten much easier to build a web page.  I mean, we were able publish videos and audio files before, but it was a whole complicated process to do that. The new tags such as &#8826;video&#8827; and &#8826;audio&#8827; have made this a simple task. Or the &#8826;div&#8827; tag! It is so much easier to section out a web page and edit it using CSS with help of the almighty &#8826;div&#8827; tag.</p>

<p>That being said, my <i style="color:green">“A-ha!”</i> moment came to me finally when I created a mini-animation using JavaScript. It was easier than I thought, but most importantly, it reminded me that I can solve any issue if I put my mind to it.</p>
