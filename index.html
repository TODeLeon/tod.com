<p>My name is Tuba Ozdil DeLeon. I was born and raised in Turkey and moved to Seattle in 2005. I currently live Everett with my son, husband, our dog and two cats. In my free time, I love crafting, trying out new recipes in the kitchen and spending time outdoors, when the weather permits. I think some of my favorite times are when we go hiking as a whole family and get to experience the natural beauty of Washington State.

<p>Since moving to Seattle, it has been my dream to become a woman working in a technology field. I attended classes at Seattle Central Community College while I was working at Bank of America, and during that time, I was able to grow my skills in MS Office, and I also got an introduction into programming in VB and Java, plus how to use applications such as Flash and Dreamweaver. I even created my own web pages. </p>

<p>During the last quarter of my education at SCCC, I was given an opportunity to work at VoiceBox Technologies, where they researched and developed Natural Language Understanding and Voice Recognition technology. Looking back now, I think this was the most exciting, rewarding experience I have had in my professional life. After Voicebox Technologies, I worked on assorted projects for companies like Google and Microsoft. Even though my skillset should have given me an advantage over my coworkers, I could never find a job where I could really use the skills I learned. For a more in depth look at my work history and skill set, please check out my <i><a id="hyperlink" href="../html/resume.html">&nbsp;Resume page.</a></i></p>

<p>I am so happy that youâ€™ve found your way to my website. If you want to know about me more, please check out my <i><a class="hyper" href="../html/interests.html">&nbsp;Interests page.</a></i></p>

<p>If you would like to reach out to me, you can leave a message on the <i><a class="hyper" href="../html/guestbook.html">&nbsp;Guest Book page.</a></i></p>
